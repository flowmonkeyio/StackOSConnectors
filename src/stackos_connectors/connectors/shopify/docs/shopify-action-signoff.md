# Shopify Action Documentation Signoff

Audit date: July 8, 2026

Scope: Shopify Admin GraphQL `2026-07`/latest documentation, the local
`plugins/shopify/plugin.yaml` catalog, static GraphQL files under
`plugins/shopify/graphql/`, and `stackos/actions/shopify.py`.

This is a documentation and contract signoff, not a live-store smoke. A real
Shopify token remains a release gate for provider connectivity.

Installed-runtime registry verification was not established by this audit;
the active packaged daemon did not contain the reviewed Shopify plugin.

## Verifier Coverage

Independent reviewers checked the copied catalog and rechecked corrected
analytics, customer, inventory, and order contracts. Final product/order
rechecks were completed by the main agent against the official sources and
focused tests. The matrix records that dated documentation review, not current
live-provider acceptance.

The safe exposed surface is 58 curated actions. The original copied
`shopifyql_query` action is intentionally removed because it accepted arbitrary
ShopifyQL, which does not match the StackOS agent-wrapper model.

## One-By-One Matrix

Status legend:

- PASS: local contract matches the documented Shopify operation.
- PASS_WITH_LIMITATION: contract matches the documented operation, with an
  explicit bounded-query, pagination, protected-data, or live-smoke limitation.
- REMOVED: action is deliberately not exposed.

| Action | Surface | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `conversion_funnel` | ShopifyQL `shopifyqlQuery` | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Re-verifier confirmed curated sessions/orders/customers/conversion_rate queries; no arbitrary query input. |
| `customer_cohort_analysis` | ShopifyQL `shopifyqlQuery` | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | First-pass verifier accepted curated customer/order aggregation; requires `read_reports`. |

| `inventory_risk_report` | Admin GraphQL products/orders/inventory | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Re-verifier confirmed added `read_orders`; connector caps internal pagination and reports truncation. |

| `get_inventory_by_sku` | Products search by `sku:` | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | First-pass verifier accepted SKU search; connector quotes search input and bounds first page. |

| `add_order_tag` | `tagsAdd` on Order | PASS | First-pass verifier accepted tags mutation contract. |

| `get_order` | `order` query | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Re-verifier confirmed `read_orders` + `read_customers`; returns first 50 line items plus pageInfo. |
| `get_order_by_name` | `orders(query: name:...)` | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Re-verifier confirmed exact-name search without forced `#`; first matching order only. |
| `get_order_fulfillment_status` | `order` fulfillment status | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Re-verifier confirmed `read_orders` scope is sufficient for selected fields. |

| `search_orders` | `orders(query:)` | PASS_WITH_LIMITATION | Manual final recheck confirmed documented order search filters and `read_customers` scope for customer fields. |
| `update_order_note` | `orderUpdate` note | PASS | First-pass verifier accepted `OrderInput.note`. |
| `update_order_tags` | `orderUpdate` tags | PASS | Manual final recheck confirmed `OrderInput.tags` replacement semantics and no tagsAdd-only append behavior. |

| `update_product_variant` | `productVariantsBulkUpdate` | PASS | Manual final recheck confirmed bulk-update contract and `userErrors.code`. |
| `shopifyql_query` | Arbitrary ShopifyQL | REMOVED | Re-verifier found this unsafe for agent exposure; catalog now rejects `shopify.shopifyql_query`. |

## Automated Evidence

- `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_repositories/test_shopify_actions.py -q`
  passed: 11 tests.
- The focused suite asserts the catalog exposes exactly 58 Shopify actions,
  rejects `shopify.shopifyql_query`, lowercases product status filters, exposes
  `UNLISTED` for product status actions, maps order tag replacement through
  `orderUpdate`, preserves variant `userErrors.code`, and verifies draft-order
  `note2`, inventory idempotency/CAS input shape, and collection creation
  argument shape.

# Communications Plugin Agent Notes

This plugin defines StackOS communication provider contracts and resources. It
does not run an assistant, classify intent, or decide workflows.

## Rules

- Provider operations are plugin actions executed through `action.run` for one
  explicit direct call or `action.execute` inside a granted run-plan step.
- Do not add provider-specific MCP tools for Telegram, Slack, SMTP, or IMAP.
- Keep Telegram, Slack, SMTP, and IMAP connectors in separate provider files.
- Treat communications as a provider-neutral graph. Use
  `communicationProfile.*`, `communicationSurface.*`,
  `communicationContact.*`, `communicationMembership.*`,
  `communicationTarget.*`, `communicationRoute.*`, and
  `communicationContext.query` for generic setup and stored-context reads.
  Use `communication.send` and `communication.reply` as the normal delivery
  path. Provider-specific actions still exist as explicit action refs, but they
  are the lower-level escape hatch for discovery/custom payload work.
- Set surface intent before using a channel for real work. A
  `communication-channel` should describe its `audience`, `intent`,
  `agent_guidance`, `data_scope`, and safe `external_context` when it can
  contain internal, customer, partner, vendor, public, or mixed data. Do not put
  credentials, tokens, private headers, or raw provider secrets in those fields.
- Treat surface intent and data scope as agent guidance, not daemon business
  logic. The agent still decides the workflow and must use target/route policy
  through `communication.send`/`communication.reply` before sending or forwarding
  anything.
- `communicationTarget.resolve` is not a send abstraction. It is a read-only
  planning/debug helper that returns static allow/deny state plus provider
  defaults. It evaluates policy with the same target/default actor profile that
  `communication.send` uses when `from` is omitted and returns
  `policy_profile_ref`. Normal agents should not use it as the default delivery
  flow.
- `communicationContext.query` returns stored StackOS history only. Live Slack
  history, Telegram updates, IMAP fetches, or future Gmail/Graph reads must be
  separate provider actions with scopes, pagination, rate-limit handling, and
  audit.
- New send/handoff routes are default-deny until a communication target/route
  and policy explicitly allow them. Do not infer cross-channel permission from
  a same-origin reply policy.
- Local agent chat is a communication transport, not a model runner hidden in
  the daemon. Store messages/interactions, create generic agent requests, and
  let the selected agent runner decide the response.
- Use `localAgentChat.createMessage` for local chat ingress. It stores
  communication resources and optionally creates a generic agent request; it
  must not invoke a model or select a workflow. For a local agent response,
  call it with `direction=outbound`, the same `thread_key`, a new
  `message_key`, and `create_request=false`.
- Telegram Accounts are global and reusable. Telegram behavior is project-scoped
  through `communication-profile` records. Accounts store daemon-held
  application/auth material, optional proxy configuration, and native session
  state only.
- Generic communication profiles store identity, default agent guidance, and
  optional structured command intents. Commands are not plain strings; each
  command may carry guidance/configuration for the operating agent. Telegram
  profile facets store only safe Telegram-specific refs/settings such as
  `credential_ref`, account kind, and provider id maps. Telegram Accounts own
  one managed TDLib session; the session's native updates enter the shared
  processor. Normal profile setup must not supply transport paths or native
  runtime state.
- Each Telegram communication profile binds to one global Account through
  `credential_ref`. The Account must be explicitly attached to the profile's
  project; never fall back to another Account or a provider-wide token.
- Slack HTTP ingress has one inbound-enabled profile owner per Account. A
  Telegram Account's TDLib session routes each native update only to its
  enabled project profiles; profile binding remains explicit and never falls
  back to another Account.
- Create and update communication profiles through `communicationProfile.upsert`.
  Inspect them through `communicationProfile.get` and
  `communicationProfile.list`. These are setup operations shared by REST,
  CLI, MCP, and UI; do not bypass them with raw resource writes in product code.
- Use `ingressEndpoint.configure`, `ingressEndpoint.refresh`,
  `ingressEndpoint.routes`, `ingressEndpoint.sync`, and
  `ingressEndpoint.status` for project-level HTTP ingress setup. The endpoint
  is generic; local tunnel provider settings belong only under `driver_config`.
  Telegram does not register an ingress route because TDLib owns its native
  connection and update stream.
- Visibility is not activation. A communication profile may observe/store messages from
  any reachable chat/channel as context, but StackOS creates an `agent_request`
  or sends a reply only when trigger policy matches and invoker access policy
  allows that user.
- Agents never receive bot tokens, SMTP passwords, IMAP passwords, webhook
  secrets, OAuth tokens, refresh tokens, or raw authorization headers.
- Telegram inline buttons must use opaque `callback_data` only. Keep it within
  Telegram's 1-64 byte limit and never place secrets, prompts, credentials, or
  business decisions in it.
- Store button/callback state as `communication-interaction` resources keyed by
  communication profile, provider message ref, and callback token. Treat callback payloads
  as untrusted routing hints until the agent has read the linked project, run,
  resource, and interaction context.
- Outbound replies that are tied to inbound work should include
  `source_agent_request_id` so response policy can enforce the originating
  communication profile, chat, thread, and message.
- Proactive sends to explicit `communication-target` records are governed by
  target/send policy. Do not force those sends through reply-origin policy.
- `telegram.callback.answer` may clear Telegram's client-side loading state for
  an eligible bot Account. It rejects user-Account calls and must not claim a
  workflow was completed unless the responsible agent or granted run actually
  completed it.
- Telegram `read` and `unread` are StackOS-local attention states only.
- Slack Web API identity, message send/delete, conversation discovery,
  membership sync, native message reactions, and signed HTTP Events
  API/Interactivity ingress are executable through the `slack-bot` connector and
  `/api/v1/ingress/slack/{project_id}/{profile_key}`.
- When Slack actions include `profile_ref`, the connector must resolve the
  `communication-profile` server-side and reject mismatches between
  `provider_facets.slack-bot.credential_ref` and the daemon-resolved Account.
  The Account is reusable across projects, while the profile and signed ingress
  URL remain project-bound.
- Slack Socket Mode remains deferred until a daemon runner owns app-token
  connection lifecycle, reconnects, and envelope ACKs.
- Slack Block Kit buttons must use opaque non-secret values only. Store button
  state as `communication-interaction` resources keyed by communication profile,
  message ref, block id, action id, and value.
- Slack `response_url`, `trigger_id`, bearer tokens, and signing secrets must
  never be persisted or returned to agents.
- SMTP acceptance is not delivery, inbox placement, read, open, click, or reply.
- IMAP message operations must use UIDs and UIDVALIDITY; do not model
  sequence-number-only actions.
- OAuth/XOAUTH2 for SMTP or IMAP stays deferred until provider-specific refresh,
  scope diagnostics, and safe auth tests exist.
- Message bodies may contain private data. Default to previews/selected fields;
  explicitly request Slack history `include_content=true` when authorized work
  needs full selected content, then inspect the normal sanitized response file.
  Do not create artifacts or duplicate full bodies just to read action output.
  IMAP previews must retain completeness facts; original receipt evidence uses
  the existing host-only export contract and its external owner.
- `agent_requests` are generic core queue records. Communications can create
  them only through trusted ingestion or granted run-plan steps.
- All communication ingress must follow one-brain processing. Provider adapters
  verify transport auth and normalize payloads; shared communication code is
  responsible for static policy evaluation, resource storage, stable request
  dedupe, and agent-request creation. Button/callback click-state updates must
  be normalized as shared processor patches, not committed directly inside
  provider ingress.
- Shared inbound policy separates visibility from activation. A bot can observe
  configured visible channels or DMs, while only approved users may create agent
  work or trigger responses. Do not reintroduce channel/chat allowlists as the
  primary answer restriction in provider adapters.

## Adding A Communication Provider

For Slack-like, Telegram-like, email, or future chat providers:

1. Add typed auth setup and safe auth tests; never expose credential payloads.
2. Add provider facets to `communication-profile` instead of a provider-specific
   global setup path.
3. Store channels, DMs, mailboxes, and rooms as `communicationSurface.*` records
   with audience, intent, data scope, and safe external context.
4. Normalize inbound provider payloads into the shared communication processor;
   provider adapters should stop after transport verification and field mapping.
5. Expose sends, live history reads, discovery, and membership sync as explicit
   plugin actions with manifest entries, mocked connector tests, pagination,
   rate-limit handling, and audit.
6. Use named `communicationTarget.*` records for outbound destinations and
   `communicationRoute.*` for cross-surface handoff guidance.
7. Do not add provider-specific MCP tools or daemon-side workflow decisions.

## Implementation Checklist

- Update this plugin manifest and the integration contract together.
- Add connector comments linking official provider docs beside each provider
  call.
- Add mocked provider tests before marking any action executable.
- Prove no-secret output for auth status, auth tests, action calls, resources,
  artifacts, and UI-visible metadata.
- Keep workflow templates generic. Templates may describe setup, context,
  approvals, and expected outputs; concrete action payloads belong in run plans.
